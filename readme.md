# CCC
Canada Computing Competition

> 加拿大计算机竞赛（CCC）是一项面向高中学生的，充满趣味的编程挑战。对于学生来说，这是一个测试他们对于算法的设计，理解和实现能力的机会。  

这些是俺做的一些CCC的练习题  

可以在[这里](http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc)查看每一题的题目要求  

有一些题我做着挺难的，所以要是有意见和Bug，欢迎反馈  

> The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun challenge for secondary school students with an interest in programming. It is an opportunity for students to test their ability in designing, understanding and implementing algorithms.

These are my practice of CCC questions.

You can read the requriments of each problem at [here](http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc).

Some of the questions are pretty difficult for me, so if you discovered any issue or bug in my codes, please tell me :)
